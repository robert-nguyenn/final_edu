  <!-- 1. SERVICE OUTCOME -->
  <section id="outcome">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-handshake"></i> Outcome of My <strong>Service‑Learning</strong> Project</h2>
    <p>
      Volunteering at the Art Center of the Bluegrass gave me the opportunity to support a wide range of tasks essential to <strong>community engagement</strong>. I covered front desk shifts where I welcomed visitors, answered questions about art exhibits, restocked flyers, and helped new guests fill out forms. During my time in the pottery department, I cleaned painting supplies, assisted in learning how to use the payment system, and observed customer interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Family Fun Day, I supported over 100 children by helping them create bracelets and drawings. I also organized and hung more than 50 pieces of children’s art, transforming the space into a gallery of their <strong>creativity</strong>. Other times, I cleaned and organized the storage room—carefully handling over 75 handmade items like teddy bears, soaps, and decorative crafts to prepare the space for upcoming events.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “People say, what is the sense of our small effort. They cannot see that we must lay one brick at a time.”
      <cite>Loeb, <em>Soul of a Citizen</em>, p. 64</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      These "<strong>small</strong>" actions taught me that <strong>leadership</strong> and <strong>service</strong> often happen behind the scenes. Loeb reminded me that these incremental efforts are the foundation of long-term change. By consistently showing up and giving my best to each task—whether organizing a space or supporting families—I contributed to the welcoming and <strong>inclusive</strong> spirit of the Art Center.

  <!-- 2. LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT -->
  <section id="leadership">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> How My <strong>Leadership</strong> Grew</h2>
    <p>
      When I first started volunteering, I thought <strong>leadership</strong> meant being the person in charge—speaking the most or making the biggest decisions. But I quickly realized that <strong>leadership</strong> can also mean being the person who listens first, who quietly helps things run smoothly, and who is present even when the work is invisible. 
    </p>

    <p>
      One example was covering the front desk by myself during a busy Saturday. A family walked in confused about summer camp registration, and instead of panicking, I calmly guided them through the process. That moment helped me understand what Robert Evans meant when he said, “The true force that attracts others is the force of the heart.”
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “<strong>Integrity</strong> is a fundamental consistency between one’s values, goals, and actions.”
      <cite>Evans, <em>The Authentic Leader</em>, p. 137</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      I learned to take <strong>initiative</strong> without waiting for direction—jumping in to restock materials, offering to help during events, or staying late to clean up when no one asked me to. These may seem like simple habits, but for me as a college student, they were huge steps in personal <strong>growth</strong>. I became more dependable, more self-aware, and more confident that I could <strong>lead by example</strong>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 3. CONNECTIONS TO READINGS & DISCUSSIONS -->
  <section id="connections">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Connecting Practice to Course Readings</h2>

    <p>
      The core concepts from EDU 230 didn’t just stay in the classroom—they came to life in every small act of <strong>service</strong> I performed. Paul Loeb’s idea that we become <strong>leaders by doing</strong>, not by preparing forever (p. 281) helped me stop overthinking whether I was ready to lead and instead just start showing up—consistently and sincerely.
    </p>

    <p>
      I wasn’t giving speeches or leading team meetings, but I was showing up early to set up, volunteering to clean up messy tables, and walking families through instructions with patience. My peers began to do the same without being asked, and that showed me that <strong>quiet leadership</strong> is still powerful.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “<strong>Leadership</strong> is communication in action. You cannot speak meaningfully in a leadership situation unless first you have listened and understood your audience.”
      <cite>Neuschel, <em>The Servant Leader</em>, p. 78</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This quote echoed through every interaction I had with parents, staff, and especially kids. I remember one child who was too nervous to start their painting. Instead of jumping in with directions, I sat beside them and asked questions about what they liked to draw. By the end, they had filled a whole page. That simple moment reflected everything we discussed about <strong>authentic</strong>, responsive <strong>leadership</strong>.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Being <strong>civic-minded</strong> is more than just what you know. It is what you do with what you know.”
      <cite>Cress et al., <em>Learning Through Serving</em>, p. 14</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This course made it clear that <strong>leadership</strong> and <strong>service</strong> are not separate. You lead by showing up, helping where it’s needed, and staying grounded in <strong>community</strong>. Each reflection journal, reading, and discussion shaped how I now approach <strong>leadership</strong>—as something rooted in action, <strong>humility</strong>, and <strong>purpose</strong>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 4. FUTURE PLANS -->
  <section id="future">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-road"></i> Plans for the <strong>Future</strong></h2>
    <p>
      This course didn’t just change how I see <strong>leadership</strong>—it changed how I see my role in the world. I now understand that I don’t have to wait until I’m in a “big” position to lead. <strong>Presence</strong>, <strong>reliability</strong>, and <strong>care</strong> are the foundation. I want to carry this mindset into both my personal life and professional goals.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a Computer Science major, I want to merge <strong>technology</strong> with <strong>service</strong>. I hope to design software and educational tools that are <strong>accessible</strong>, especially for underserved students in my home country of Vietnam. I also plan to stay engaged locally—continuing to volunteer with <strong>community</strong> projects in Danville and mentoring fellow students through my campus organizations.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Create digital learning platforms for rural Vietnamese students with limited internet access.</li>
      <li>Mentor first-year college students, especially international students navigating <strong>service</strong> and <strong>leadership</strong> roles.</li>
      <li>Use software not just to solve problems—but to reflect values like <strong>inclusion</strong>, <strong>dignity</strong>, and <strong>empathy</strong>.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>
      “As the familiar adage counsels, we can’t run without first learning how to walk, and we can’t walk without first learning how to crawl.”
      <cite>Loeb, <em>Soul of a Citizen</em>, p. 75</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      EDU 230 helped me <strong>crawl</strong>—carefully, reflectively, and with <strong>purpose</strong>. Now I’m ready to <strong>walk</strong>.
